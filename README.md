# **Cypherex**

A secure, decentralized, and offline-first password manager built on the **Polkadot network**. This open-source project enables users to manage passwords securely by leveraging blockchain technology, designed for use with **Raspberry Pi Zero boards** or **USB drives**.

---

## **Features**

- **Blockchain Integration:** Store passwords securely on Polkadot's blockchain with minimal transaction fees.  
- **Offline First:** Operates as a standalone system on Raspberry Pi Zero boards or USB drives, ensuring privacy and security.  
- **Rust-Powered:** Built with Rust for performance, reliability, and safety.  
- **Open Source:** Free to use and modify under specific terms.  
- **Tipping Supported:** Show appreciation by tipping the developer for continued improvements and support.  

---

## **How It Works**

### Password Storage on Blockchain
Passwords are encrypted and stored on the Polkadot blockchain, requiring a small fee slightly above the networkâ€™s base fee for each transaction. This ensures a secure and immutable storage solution.

---

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- A Raspberry Pi Zero board or a USB thumb drive.  
- Rust development environment installed.  
  [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

### **Steps for Raspberry Pi Zero**

1. Clone the repository to your Raspberry Pi:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-password-manager.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
     cd crypto-password-manager
  
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
    cargo build --release
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/crypto-password-manager

---

### **Steps for USB Drive**

1. Clone the repository on your computer:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-password-manager.git

2. Compile the project for your target device:
   ```bash
    cargo build --release
3. Transfer the compiled binaries to your USB drive:
   ```bash
    cp ./target/release/crypto-password-manager /path/to/usb/
4.Plug the USB into your device and run the application.

## **Disclaimer**

Passwords are encrypted using various cryptography methods before being stored on the Polkadot blockchain. Users must have a Polkadot wallet and sufficient funds to cover the small transaction fees for storing passwords.
